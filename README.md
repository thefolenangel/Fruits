The firing is carried out in columns, top-down or bottom-up and the location of impact (the column under fire) is set by scroller (scroll bar). Because of the inaccuracy of the scroll wheel, the player is not quite sure in which column will shoot. Thus, in each shot has a chance missed and it makes the game more interesting (like the slingshot in Angry Birds).
